	<h1 class="title"><span>The</span> <b>Good Life</b></h1>
	<aside class="notes">
		<p>Hi, my name is Richard, and I’m here today to talk to you about what is best in life.</p>
		<p>I originally wrote this talk for an audience of front-end web developers, but it applies broadly to anyone who works in tech or engineering disciplines, or anyone who cares about ethics in tech.</p>
		<p>It's called The Good Life, or as I like to call it: Actually, it's about ethics in software engineering.</p>
	</aside>

<section data-background="img/fedora.jpg" data-background-size="contain">
	<h3><b class="actually">Actually,</b> it's about ethics in software engineering</h3>
	<aside class="notes">
		<p>About my background: I started out at university studying mechanical engineering, which I hated. I quickly switched to philosophy, which I loved. Now, ten years later, my official job title is front end engineer. Go figure.</p>
		<p>So I'm a front-end engineer these days, but I usually refer to myself as a developer. I've always felt a bit uncomfortable with the title of engineer, though I couldn't really put my finger on why. Maybe it felt a bit like I was claiming some sort of prestige that I hadn't earned?</p>
		<p>I didn't complete my engineering degree or study computer science: I'm mostly self-taught. I like to think I’m pretty good at my job, but I still feel like I'm hacking stuff together a lot of the time.</p>

<section data-background="img/webmaster.jpg" data-background-size="contain">
	<aside class="notes">
		<p>Back in the day, many of us who build websites used to call ourselves webmasters. Which I still think is an amazing job title, btw. I'm kinda sad that I didn't start my career quite early enough to have a webmaster role in the job history section of my CV. It's a bit like Social Justice Warrior, like, people use it as an insult but frankly I think it sounds badass.</p>
		<p>Anyway so we were webmasters - and webmistresses...</p>
</section>
<section data-background="img/webmistress.jpg" data-background-size="contain">
	<aside class="notes">
		<p>And then that title fell out of fashion and we became web developers, and now many of us have the very professional-sounding title of front-end engineers.</p>
		<p>I don’t think that's a bad thing, or that we should stop calling ourselves engineers - call yourself whatever you want, you can be a techno-viking or an agile pirate-ninja riding a full-stack glitter-unicorn if it makes you feel better.</p>

		<p>But we used to be working on dinky little websites that were kind of thrown together, and now we're working on massive, professional operations that form the financial backbone of multi-billion dollar corporations. We've come a long, long way from being webmasters and webmistresses.</p>
		<p>But a lot of us are self-taught and didn't go through any standardised training process. And don't get me wrong, this is great, it helps ease barriers to entry. But as the industry gets more professional, it might be worth thinking about other trappings of professionalism. If we're going to call ourselves engineers, then there are ethical duties and codes of responsibility that go along with that title.</p>

		<p>A hundred years ago, civil engineering was in a similar situation to how the tech industry is now. As the industrial revolution receded behind them, engineers found new ways to use all the fancy new technologies they had developed. They grew more sophisticated in their approach, and their projects ballooned in scale and complexity.</p>
		<p>But as these projects became more ambitious, there was an accompanying problem: A rise in major engineering disasters. The turn of the twentieth century saw a wave of epic structural failures, including some massive bridge collapses,</p>

		<p>&hellip;and also the Great Boston Molasses Flood, which you can see here.</p>
		<p>Which, if I had to name my favourite disaster of all time, this would have to be it, just for the mental image of a tsunami of liquid sugar 50 feet high, travelling 35 miles an hour, consuming everything in its path. It's terrifying, but also, kinda delicious?</p>
		<p>Anyway these disasters had a profound effect on the way the public saw engineering, and forced engineers to confront their shortcomings.</p>
		<p>As a result, they began to regulate themselves more intensely, and established standardised industry codes of ethics.</p>

		<p>Philosophers like to do things called "thought experiments", which are like real experiments but even better, because you never need to get out of your armchair.</p>
		<p>One of the most famous is the trolley problem. I'm sure many of you are already familiar with it, but for those who aren't, here's the deal.</p>
	</aside>

<section data-background="img/trolley-problem.jpg" data-background-color="white" data-background-size="contain">
	<aside class="notes">
		<p>There is a runaway trolley barreling down the railway tracks. Ahead, on the tracks, there are five people tied up and unable to move. The trolley is headed straight for them. You are standing some distance off in the train yard, next to a lever. If you pull this lever, the trolley will switch to a different set of tracks. However, you notice that there is one person on the side track. You have two options:</p>
		<p>Do nothing, and the trolley kills the five people on the main track.</p>
		<p>Pull the lever, diverting the trolley onto the side track where it will kill one person.</p>
		<p>Which is the most ethical choice? Quick show of hands, no wrong answers.</p>
	</aside>
</section>
<section data-background="img/fat-man.jpg" data-background-color="white" data-background-size="contain">
	<aside class="notes">
		<p>Now, imagine instead of a switch, you’re standing on a bridge over the tracks, next to an extremely large man. The trolley is coming, and the only way you can stop it is to push the large man onto the tracks. He’s the only one big enough to slow down the trolley.</p>
		<p>He’s looking you right in the eyes, he can see what you’re thinking, and he’s terrified, begging you not to do it. What do you do?</p>

<section>
	<p><div class="emoji">🛠</div> 9 out of 10 people would<br> throw the switch,</p>
	<p><div class="emoji emoji--gap">🙅‍♂️</div> but only 1 in 10 people would<br> push the large man.</p>
	<aside class="notes">
		<p>The trolley problem has been the subject of many surveys, which tend to find that approximately 9 out of 10 respondents would throw the switch to kill the one and save the five.</p>
		<p>However in the large man scenario, the situation reverses, and only 1 in 10 people would push him onto the tracks.</p>
		<p>Incidentally, a 2009 survey of professional philosophers found that only 68% of them would throw the switch, 8% would not switch, and the remaining 24% had another view or could not answer. So if you’re ever tied to a train track by a cartoon villain, you’d better hope that the person by the switch isn’t a moral philosopher.</p>

</section>
<section data-background="img/brain.gif" data-background-size="cover">
	<aside class="notes">
		<p>So why the difference in the two outcomes?</p>
		<p>One theory is that it's because two different parts of your brain are fighting with each other.</p>
		<p>Some researchers looked at people’s brains using fMRI machines, and demonstrated that "personal" dilemmas (like pushing a man off a footbridge) engage brain regions associated with emotion, whereas "impersonal" dilemmas (like diverting the trolley by flipping a switch) engaged regions associated with controlled reasoning.</p>
		<p>And these different brain processes essentially compete with each other whenever you have to make a tough moral decision.</p>
	</aside>
</section>
<section data-background="img/mvr.jpg" data-background-color="white" data-background-size="contain">
	<aside class="notes">
		<p>Basically, inside your brain, you’ve got a monkey and a robot fighting over the controls. Every time you have to make a moral decision, they duke it out.</p>
		<p>The monkey understands something simple like pushing someone off a bridge, and it's horrified. But it doesn't understand something complex like a mechanical switch, so in that situation, the gut response is reduced, and we're able to throw the lever without feeling such a crushing sense of moral horror.</p>
		<p>Now some people have a stronger monkey, and some people have a stronger robot, and that's great, because both are useful in different situations.</p>
		<p>But this is tricky for we programmers, because we work on complex problems, which might make it trickier for our monkey brains to trigger some kinds of moral responses.</p>

<section data-background="img/self-driving-cars.jpg" data-background-size="cover">
	<aside class="notes">
		<p>By the way, if you think it's hard for programmers to experience the full range of ethical response, then spare a thought for autonomous vehicles.</p>
		<p>Self-driving cars don’t have meat brains, and you can’t make a perfectly ethical algorithm: You can only make it as good as the humans who programmed it, and we can’t even agree on whether to use tabs or spaces.</p>

		<p>There are also some really tricky problems here that self-driving cars will face. Like, we'd prefer a self-driving car to swerve into a pile of trash rather than hit someone, just like a person might. But computers can make these kinds of decisions much quicker than we can, so if we decide in advance what we want them to do, they'll follow our instructions.</p>
		<p>So, we'd probably want to program our car to hit a single adult rather than bus-load of school children, right? But what if the adult is a Nobel-prize winning cancer researcher? What if the adult is driving the car? Would we want the car to sacrifice its driver? And would you choose to buy a self-driving car that's designed to sacrifice your life to save others?</p>

		<p>Some researchers at MIT came up with a nice solution for this: They built an app to mine data on people’s answers to different trolley problems, so they can use it to help them decide how autonomous cars should behave in different scenarios.</p>
		<p>The website is called Moral Machine, and you can go there right now and start judging scenarios, like this one, where you have to choose between a male athlete driving a car, and a jaywalking baby. On the one hand, the baby probably doesn't know not to cross on a red signal, but on the other hand, it might grow up to be Hitler, you know? So it's a tough call.</p>
		<!-- <p>Anyway, Moral Machine is cool, but it doesn't help us, because we can't outsource all our ethical decision-making to the internet. We're just individuals working on our laptops, and we have these ridiculous meat brains, and we have to make our own decisions about things like whether to kill baby Hitler.</p>

	There are loads of different ways in which we face moral dilemmas in software engineering.

		Dark patterns?

		Bias in algorithms. We can't be objective.

	<aside class="notes">
		<p>So far, I've covered a few examples of ethical dilemmas in software engineering. But what are some examples of ethical decisions that specifically affect front-end developers?</p>
		<p>DOWN</p>
		<p>Well, security, for a start. Caring about proper website security is a thankless task, where your manager or client usually won't notice if you've done your job right. But if you don't do it, you can run the risk of pulling an Equifax and completely screwing over your users.</p>
		Privacy e.g. GDPR etc
		<p>DOWN</p>
		<p>Similarly, you're making a moral decision in choosing how much effort to put into accessibility. In my experience, it's usually a choice between being lazy, and making access possible for disabled people.</p>
		<p>DOWN</p>
		<p>Deciding who to work for, and prioritising what to work on. Would you work for a tobacco company? A gun manufacturer? A gambling website, or a porn website?</p>

		<p>Like Mr Von Braun here, who knew he couldn't be in the forefront of rocket research in Germany if he didn't join all the right organisations – and he didn't care what crimes to turn a blind eye to as long as he was allowed to play with his rockets.</p>
		<p>So let me be clear: Nobody is exempt from having to behave ethically. Ethics contaminates everything, and nobody is amoral. Whether you're building rockets or designing algorithms to help police identify gang members, you have a duty to consider how they might be used.</p>

		<p>There's some good news, though: If it's easy for people to act unethically when they don't think about it, then the flip side to this, is that it follows that people tend to behave more ethically when you remind them to.</p>

			<p>These are a very good way to remind people to act ethically. Because basically, when you tell people “hey don’t be a dick”, they will be less likely to be a dick.</p>

		<p><div class="emoji">🐒</div> Would you be happy for everyone to know<br> the decision you’ve made?</p>
		<p><div class="emoji emoji--gap">🤖</div> Do you think the consequences are acceptable?</p>
		<p><div class="emoji emoji--gap">🤔</div> Would you recommend the same course<br> of action to others?</p>
		<aside class="notes">
			<p>So whenever they are trying to make a hard decision, they have these questions they can use,which are designed to trigger different types of emotional responses.</p>
			<p>So you've got the first one here, which I think is quite a monkey brain question, it's a good one for triggering emotional reactions like shame.</p>
			<p>So for example, if you're considerig being lazy about making your website accessible, imagine there's a disabled person sitting next to you, and think about whether you'd feel comfortable explaining your code choices to them.</p>
			<p>The second one seems designed to trigger more of a consequentialist response. It's maybe a bit of a rationalist, robot-brained approach?</p>
			<p>The last one reminds of Immanuel Kant's categorical imperative, that you should only do something if you'd be okay with it being a universal law. So that's cool too, if Kant's your thing.</p>
			<p>Overall I really like them: Good job psychotherapists!</p>

		<h2>Empower developers<br> to feel able to say no</h2>
		<aside class="notes">
			<p>A few years ago, I was working for a consultancy, who assigned me to a website project for a client I didn't approve of. But I got so invested in solving the technical aspects of the project, that I didn't stop to think about whether I was morally okay with working for this client, until I was already deeply invested. I moaned about the client to some colleagues, and they told me, if you didn't want to work for this client, that's fine, but you should have said something at the start of this project.</p>
			<p>It made me realise that it was okay to say no to client projects, but also that the appropriate time to do that is before you start work. The later you leave it, the harder it is to say no.</p>
			<p>The next time a dodgy client came along, I felt more comfortable expressing my concerns up-front, and we ended up turning down the client.</p>

		<h2>Communicate ethical principles</h2>
		<aside class="notes">
			<p>We can help encourage this sort of feedback by building these sorts of checks into our processes.</p>
			<p>One way you could do this is to add a checklist step in your p</p>
			<!--
				Think about what sort of ethical principles you'd choose for your own work, your team and your company.
				Get in the habit of considering consequences at the planning stage of a new project or feature. Maybe build it into your processes, include it in your documentation, or even introduce it as a step in a checklist?
				
				Discuss with your colleagues.

				Next, find ways to communicate these principles and establish them as part of the company culture. This could include adding it to your onboarding process for new starters. It could be company-wide emails, slack discussions, poster campaigns, or committees. Find whatever works for you and your team.

				Onboarding new starters
				Publicity campaigns
				Company-wide emails

		<aside class="notes">
			<p>On that note: If you speak up about ethically dubious practices at your workplace and your employer doesn't listen, you may have a duty to report it to the authorities or otherwise make it public!</p>
			<p>A basic dilemma in engineering ethics is that an engineer has a duty to their client or employer, but an even greater duty to report a possible risk to others from a client or employer failing to follow the engineer's directions.</p>
			<p>A classic example of this is the Challenger Space Shuttle Disaster. NASA engineers raised warnings about faulty O-rings in the boosters, and the dangers posed by the low temperatures on the morning of the launch, but managers disregarded these warnings, and failed to adequately report these technical concerns to their superiors.</p>
			<p>It was later argued that in these circumstances, the engineers had had a duty to circumvent their managers and shout about the dangers until they were heard.</p>

	<h2>Encourage developers <br>to meet users</h2>
	<aside class="notes">
		<p>Finally, we can help engineers to develop more empathy for their users, by encouraging them to meet them in person. A great way to do this is to get devs to sit in on user-testing sessions.</p>
		<p>A nice additional benefit of this is that empathy for your users helps you design better user-centred solutions, too. Win-win.</p>
